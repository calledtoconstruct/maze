11) Create src/test/java
12) Create MazeTestSuite.java
13) Create MazeTestSuite class import org.junit.runner.RunWith, org.junit.runners.Suite
14) Annotations @RunWith(Suite.class), @Suite.SuiteClasses({ ... })
15) Create MazeTest.java
16) Create MazeTest class import org.junit.Test, static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals
17) Create thenTest method annotation @Test
18) Include mockito and junit

Goal: Implement a maze follower

US1) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to receive a maze with a 'S' start and 'E' end point, 'W' walls, and ' ' pathways,
    So that I can follow the path from start to end

US2) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to find the 'S' start point,
    So that I can begin

US3) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to find an adjacent ' ' pathway,
    So that I can move there

US4) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to move to an adjacent ' ' pathway, leaving a '*' breadcrumb where I was, and noting my 'C' current position,
    So that I can remember the path I took

US5) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to detect when I have reached the 'E' end of the maze,
    So that I can declare victory!

Stretch Goal: Write additional user stories

Idea) Have the ability to detect a dead-end, backtrack and look for an alternate path
Idea) Find the shortest path
