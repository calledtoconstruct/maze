US1) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to receive a maze with a 'S' start and 'E' end point, 'W' walls, and ' ' pathways,
    So that I can follow the path from start to end\

    Given: I have received a board
    And: it lacks both 1 S and 1 E
    When: I validate the board
    Then: Error is thrown stating "Missing both 1 S and 1 E"

    Given: I have received a board
    And: it does not have 1 S and contains 1 E
    When: I validate the board
    Then: Error is thrown stating "Missing 1 S"

    Given: I have received a board
    And: it does not have 1 E and contains 1 S
    When: I validate the board
    Then: Error is thrown stating "Missing 1 E"


US2) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to find the 'S' start point,
    So that I can begin

    Given: Our current location is unknown, and we have an unnavigated board
    When: I search the board for 'S'
    Then: Our current XY coordinates are known

US3) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to find an adjacent ' ' pathway,
    So that I can move there

    Given: Our current location is known
    When: I search adjacent spaces
    Then: I receive XY coordinates of that empty space

    Given: Our current location is known, and no adjacent space is empty,
    When: I search adjacent spaces
    Then: An exception is thrown.

US4) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to move to an adjacent ' ' pathway, leaving a '*' breadcrumb where I was, and noting my 'C' current position,
    So that I can remember the path I took

    Given: Our current location is known,
    And: an adjacent empty space exists,
    When: I move to the adjancent empty space
    Then: My previous location is filled with an breadcrumb '*'

    Given: Our current location is known,
    And: an adjacent empty space exists,
    When: I move to the adjancent empty space,
    Then: My current position is filled with a 'C'

US5) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to detect when I have reached the 'E' end of the maze,
    So that I can declare victory!

Stretch Goal: Write additional user stories

Idea) Have the ability to detect a dead-end, backtrack and look for an alternate path
Idea) Find the shortest path
