Goal: Setup working environment from scratch

1) Create configure.cmd
    SET JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_161
    SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\apache-maven-3.6.0\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_161\jre\bin
2) Install JDK
3) Install Maven
4) Setup pom.xml
5) Set <groupId>
6) Set <artifactId>
7) Set <version>
7.5) Set <properties> for java version <maven.compiler.source> and <maven.compiler.target>
8) Create src/main/java
9) Create Application.java
10) Create Application class
11) Create src/test/java
12) Create MazeTestSuite.java
13) Create MazeTestSuite class import org.junit.runner.RunWith, org.junit.runners.Suite
14) Annotations @RunWith(Suite.class), @Suite.SuiteClasses({ ... })
15) Create MazeTest.java
16) Create MazeTest class import org.junit.Test, static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals
17) Create thenTest method annotation @Test
18) Include mockito and junit
19) Write test
20) Write code
21) Maven clean package

Goal: Implement a maze follower

board:

"WWWWWWWWWWWW",
"WS         W",
"WWWWWWWWWW W",
"W          W",
"WEWWWWWWWWWW",
"WWW"

US1) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to receive a maze with a 'S' start and 'E' end point, 'W' walls, and ' ' pathways,
    So that I can follow the path from start to end

    Given: I don't have a board,
    When: I'm instantiated with a board 
    Then: I store a reference to the board (for future use)

    Given: I have received a board
    And: it contains both 1 S and 1 E
    When: I validate the board
    Then: No error is thrown

    Given: I have received a board
    And: it lacks both 1 S and 1 E
    When: I validate the board
    Then: Error is thrown stating "Missing both 1 S and 1 E"

    Given: I have received a board
    And: it does not have 1 S and contains 1 E
    When: I validate the board
    Then: Error is thrown stating "Missing 1 S"

    Given: I have received a board
    And: it does not have 1 E and contains 1 S
    When: I validate the board
    Then: Error is thrown stating "Missing 1 E"


US2) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to find the 'S' start point,
    So that I can begin

    Given: Our current location is unknown, and we have an unnavigated board
    When: I search the board for 'S'
    Then: Our current XY coordinates are known

US3) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to find an adjacent ' ' pathway,
    So that I can move there

    Given: Our current location is known
    When: I search adjacent spaces
    Then: I receive XY coordinates of that empty space

    Given: Our current location is known, and no adjacent space is empty,
    When: I search adjacent spaces
    Then: An exception is thrown.

US4) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to move to an adjacent ' ' pathway,
        leaving a '*' breadcrumb where I was,
        and noting my 'C' current position,
    So that I can remember the path I took

US5) As a maze follower,
    I want the ability to detect when I have reached the 'E' end of the maze,
    So that I can declare victory!

Stretch Goal: Write additional user stories

Idea) Have the ability to detect a dead-end, backtrack and look for an alternate path
Idea) Find the shortest path
